# This is a simple blog website created using React JS for front end and Express JS for back end

Currently this runs on local host only

## How to view this website

## For back end

In the api directory, run:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`

this will start the back end api

## For front end

In the client directory, run:

### `yarn install`
### `yarn start`

this will start the front end

## How this works

This is basically a MERN stack website, the blog posts are stored in mongo db, which is hosted on Microsoft Azure Cloud.
